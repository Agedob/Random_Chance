    <!-- Let's play the slots!

    Make a function that takes a number of quarters (1 quarter = 1 game).

    There is a 1 in 100 chance to win the slot machine (which will give you between 50 - 100 quarters 
     use Math.random and Math.floor to pick a random number of coins).

    While the user still has quarters, use Math.random to determine if they won.

    If they ever win, return the number of quarters (ex: they had 50 remaining quarters and won 90, so it should return 140).

    Return 0 if all the quarters were wasted -->
